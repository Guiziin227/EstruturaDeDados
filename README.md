# Data Structures Study Project

## Overview

This project is part of my studies on data structures using various programming languages such as Java, C#, and Golang, with a primary focus on Java. The goal is to understand and implement different data structures, including lists and hash maps, and explore their applications and performance.

## Topics Covered

- **Lists**: Implementation and manipulation of lists, including operations like adding, removing, and iterating over elements.
- **Hash Maps**: Understanding hash maps, their usage, and operations such as insertion, deletion, and lookup.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementing and comparing different sorting algorithms.
- **Search Algorithms**: Exploring various search algorithms and their efficiency.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Analyzing the time and space complexity of different data structures and algorithms.
